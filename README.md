This project paper which investigates the role of the natural environment in happiness. In more detail, we will investigate the link between the Happiness Index of European Union (EU) cities and the Green Urban Areas (GUAs) such as parks, forests and herbaceous vegetation associations in those cities. The presence and quantity or availability of GUAs may be more or less appropriate for analysing the role of GUAs in health enhancement and improvement of life´s quality (Poelman, 2016) , therefore we chose the quantitative statistical methods for our project. This project aims to capture the spatial aspect of the natural environment´s role in life satisfaction evaluation by looking at how the amount of GUAs, their proximity and the distribution of population around them is connected to the Happiness Index.  Our research paper asks the following general research questions: “How green is happiness?”, and  “Are cities with more individuals living closer to GUAs happier?”. The following hypotheses were formulated:

H1: The overall size of GUAs is higher in countries/cities with higher Happiness Index
H2: The happier the city/country the bigger the measure of GUA size per capita (calculated from total population count as well as population count within 400m distance from GUAs to capture the proximity element)
H3: The population is more densely distributed around GUAs (within 400m distance) in countries/cities with higher Happiness Index
